        <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
              This  paper  shall  describe  the  development  process  of  a  project  which  will devise 
              a prototype called "ISEIS" also known as IOT Smart Egg Incubation System. It is a device 
              which simulates an incubator by keeping eggs warm with the appropriate humidity using Arduino 
              platform for the reason to hatch the eggs.
              
              <br><br>The egg hatching incubator machine is equipped with DHT22 (Temperature and humidity) sensor, 
              Heating elements, humidifier, fans that able to automatically monitor and 2 regulate the inside 
              environment of the incubator is in the ideal condition to incubate eggs. 
              The entire system will be controlled using NODEMCU (Arduino control system) as the brain of 
              the system. The system has a LCD display and user buttons for user customization on site and 
              an andriod application for the wireless monitoring and control via a remote server (Google Firebase).

        <p>
          Incubator is a device used in various biological process and egg hatching as well. 
          Using incubator the process of incubation can be speed up and the egg can be incubates 
          in large quantity of scale. There are many development of egg incubator today with a 
          controlled temperature, but the controls are usually not fully automated control not 
          all incubators will produce a good incubation process, contributing to potential loss 
          of hatching eggs. Thus, I have come out with a design of smart egg incubator using Arduino. 
          Smart Incubator is designed to reduce abnormal chicks and to reduce the risk of damage eggs 
          caused by uncertain environment. This system will take 18 to 22 days to hatch eggs by 
          controlling the Incubation chamber. The system is fully automated system and easy to handle. 
          The system will control the temperature and the humidity which meet the objective of this 
          project. The  "ISEIS" involves the integration between hardware and software elements. 
          It also features a monitoring system that allows the owner to control the incubatorâ€™s setting 
          remotely even from a smart phone; over the internet. The monitoring system is developed 
          using MIT App Inventor which is very popular tool for android app developments. As for the 
          hardware part, NodeMCU (An Arduino development proto board) will act as the microcomputer that 
          can be programmed based on a specific function. <br><br>

          ISEIS will allow the fetuses inside the eggs to grow and hatch without the mother (hens) being 
          present. This project is developed for the specific reason which is to assist the small, medium 
          and large-scale  farmers  from  the  technological  perspective,  so  that  their  productivity  
          can  be  increased  significantly.

              The program first clears P1.0 for activating phase 1 (A1) of the stepper motor. 
              This condition is maintained for 65mS and then P1.0 is set for deactivating phase 1 
              of the motor. Then the same process is repeated for the port pins P1.1 to P1.3 and 
              the entire cycle is repeated over and over to make the motor rotate in the clockwise direction.

              Timer 0 of the microcontroller is configured in Mode1 for producing the 65mS delay. 
              65mS is the width of each control pulse.
